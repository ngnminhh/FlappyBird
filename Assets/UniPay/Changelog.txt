- Import your old JSON config in the new version
- Scenes with references to previous scripts could have lost their connection, shown by the message: "Missing types referenced from component ...".
  Open your scene file in a text editor and replace all occurences for "ns: SIS" with "ns: UniPay" and "SIS." with "UniPay."
- If you've manually placed ShopItem2D prefabs with virtual currency cost in your scenes, you will have to reference their currency in the inspector again

- PlayFab users: PlayFab Economy V1 to V2 is a major upgrade, see version 5.4.0 below for details. BREAKING CHANGES!

v5.4.0 Beta (GitHub only)
For PlayFab users: THIS VERSION IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE

- added full support for receipt validation on Android, iOS, Steam etc. for inventory synchronization
- changed CloudScript method contents for Azure in order to support the updated Economy V2 API
- removed direct PayPal and Steam payments as they are no longer supported by PlayFab.
  Please consider using their native integration counterparts in UniPay
- removed 'Validation Only' PlayFabManager option
Please see the new PlayFab Economy V2 integration guide in the documentation

v5.3.1
- fixed ReceiptValidatorClient not immediately confirming purchase after validation but on next app launch
  This was introduced since Unity IAP 4.2.0 and caused consumables to be granted twice. If you are only
  using the ReceiptValidatorClient (not -Server) and sell consumables in your app, update asap!

- fixed ReceiptValidatorServer missing UNITY_STANDALONE_OSX platform define in some cases
- removed necessity of doing a code change in ReceiptValidatorClient in order to enable its compilation

v5.3.0
- added loading window to UIShopFeedback that is displayed during native purchase dialog interaction.
  Especially useful on IOS where the popup takes long to load. This window is being closed automatically and
  cannot be closed by the user. If you do not want to use it, keep it unassigned on the UIShopFeedback component
- added the loading window prefab and reference to all example scenes
- fixed possibility for ReceiptValidatorServer sending a validation request for the same product multiple times
- fixed order of feedback windows so that with PayPal, an error message is not hidden by the confirmation window

  unfortunately the ability to request user's local currency prices adds up to 1 second of delay to IAP initialization
- changed DBManager encryption options to dropdown, will be moved to Project Settings in a later update
- changed possibility to delete local IAP data via IAPSettings > Tools button to be only available at runtime
- changed default DBManager storage key from "data" to "SIS_data", adding automatic data takeover from old key

v5.2.3
- added StorageTarget dropdown to DBManager supporting Application.persistentDataPath as a new data storage location

- changed asset documentation moving everything from included PDF file to online documentation page on GitLab
- removed "MemoryOnly" checkbox on DBManager, this was incorporated into the StorageTarget dropdown

- changed PlayFab cloud scripts from legacy to (new) Azure functions. See updated PlayFab guide for instructions
- changed IAPManager's RestoreTransactions method to also work for Google Play without or with local or server receipt validation

- Unity IAP compatibility updated to 4.2.1+

UPGRADE NOTES
- Because some scripts have been renamed, the Simple IAP System > Scripts folder should be deleted before updating to this version. Do not delete or overwrite the IAPListener script (if you modified it) and the IAPSettings asset to keep your changes
- The previous Vertical/Horizontal example scenes have been replaced. If you have been using those in your app, recheck them regarding graphics and references and ensure they still work as desired
- Make sure that your project is linked to the Unity Gaming Services backend (Project Settings > Services tab) since Unity IAP now requires it
- As the ShopItem2D's 'buyTrigger' variable was removed, you'll have to remove the button from your self-created shop item prefabs too.
- Place the 'Window - Purchase' prefab into your shop scene to make use of the new purchase confirmation workflow. Assign a reference of it to the UIShopFeedback component.
- Reassign missing references of the UIShopFeedback component in your shop scene, e.g. a reference from the 'Window - Message' prefab to the 'messageWindow' variable
- If you are using your own 'Window - Message' prefab, you have to attach the new UIWindowMessage component to it and assign corresponding references first
- If you have been using PlayFab or VR before, import the separate extension package from the Project Settings' Setup tab. Check the new scenes provided
- If you are using PlayFab, update the PlayFab SDK to at least 2.130.x in order to support the new Azure cloud script requests

- added support for Server-Side Receipt Validation using our platform: https://flobuk.com/validator
  Get notified with active and expired subscriptions, inform users about billing issues, make sure transactions are valid and unique across your app.
  The ReceiptValidatorServer script has been added for this reason.

v5.0.7
- added support for native PayPal subscription order processing. As with non-subscription PayPal transactions, note that you have to track user inventory and subscription state yourself

v5.0 (Simple IAP System 2)
THIS VERSION IS NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE
- added native PayPal billing, primarily for selling physical products. This means you can now sell native in-app purchases e.g. on mobile platforms and physical products in parallel
- added Xsolla payments. The integration with Xsolla allows support for hundreds of localpayment gateways, including user inventory, cloud save and promotional sales.
  This makes it a perfect opportunity on alternative platforms that do not force you into using their native in-app solutions (e.g. standalone, WebGL, and mobile platforms outside Google/Apple)

- changed consumable product DBManager storage key from "Player" to "Content". Consumables bought and stored with the old format will not be found by the DBManager
- changed "Validation Only" integrated in PlayfabManager. The platform define is gone.
- changed ShopManager, it is no longer responsible for handling product shop instantiation
- changed requirements, there can now be multiple entries to unlock instead of only one

- removed IAP Settings editor window, reimplemented under Project Settings
- removed support for Samsung/Oculus Gear VR following Unity's deprecation last year
- removed Vertical, Horizontal and VerticalMenu, HorizontalMenu example scenes
- removed public support for server-side validation, as there is a new service planned for this later this year. If you've used it before, see the updated C# file on the support forum
- renamed IAPEditorExporter class to IAPSettingsExporter, updated for this version
- renamed VerticalTabs, HorizontalTabs example scenes to Vertical2D, Horizontal2D
- renamed IAPItem shop representation class to ShopItem2D
- renamed UpdateFunds currency update class to CurrencyContainer

- minimum required Unity version: 2019.4.0

Upgrade notes (from Simple IAP System 1)
- Export your products in the IAP Settings Editor before upgrading. Import your configuration under Edit > Project Settings > Simple IAP System > Tools. Check product rewards and costs.
- Since the IAPItem class was renamed, it is likely that the UI elements lost their references. Therefore, your shop item prefabs must be set up with the new ShopItem2D component again.
- Currency display in the scene must use the CurrencyContainer script instead of UpdateFunds.
- If you have used automatic shop item instantiation, check the IAPContainer components in your shop scene. You will have to select the category to instantiate items from in the inspector.
- ShopManager class was renamed to UIShopFeedback. If you have used that in your shop scene, check its references to the message/confirm window and message label.
- Due to the changed storage format on consumables (Player -> Content key), consider adding a data take-over scenario for consumable products,
  in case you previously implemented any which add more than 1 to the owned amount (Usage > 1). Skipping this would result in lost user data.
- Use the IAPManager.RestoreTransactions method instead of "purchasing" a "restore" product
